    <img src="About_Me/Ian.jpeg" alt="Ian Carroll" width=250px>
    <p>Ian is a passionate visual storyteller with over 10 years of experience writing, shooting, editing, and teaching graphic design and the video production process. He is a proficient camera operator that uses light, lenses, movement and framing to tell a compelling story with imagery and empathy. Ian was buried in books and movies for his entire childhood. Given to writing fiction and poetry he was encouraged by teachers and family to pursue his passion for storytelling. In 1998, at the age of 13, Ian bought his first camera from ebay. He would often be found filming around his neighborhood as it stood in for fantastic locations. Ian pursued a degree in film history and theory from the University of Georgia, during this time he began working as a freelance filmmaker and graphic designer. He has been lucky enough to have his work seen in galleries across the U.S. and film festivals around the world.  He has even seen some of the locations he used to imagine; he has flown drones off the Spanish Coast and shot video throughout the Italian countryside, he even got the chance to film a movie in Morocco. While the cameras have gotten better and the locations more fantastic. Ian is still doing the thing heâ€™s loved since he was a child, finding an interesting way to tell a story.</p>
